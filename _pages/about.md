Hi, I'm Zeke. Welcome to my personal site. ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a software engineer at [Square](https://squareup.com) in San Francisco, California. I work on full stack web development. In my free time I enjoy experimenting with web technologies, and developing for Apple platforms.

My hobbies include:
+ Programming
+ Music
+ Video Games
+ Studying Japanese
+ Reading news (politics)
+ Long Drives
+ Engaging in uninteresting activities with friends


Here's a few of my current favorite things:
+ [Persona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(series))
+ [Project Diva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsune_Miku:_Project_DIVA)
+ [Lorde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorde)
+ [Taylor Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift)
+ [Apple hardware & software](https://apple.com)
