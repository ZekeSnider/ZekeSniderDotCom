It's been 364 days since my last post, so I'm getting right in under that 1 year mark so that I can still declare that my blog is regularly updated. Here are some boring random tidbits that somehow constitute a blog post. 

Also, I am hereby committing to posting a technical blog post about the status of [Jared](https://github.com/zekesnider/jared) within the next week!!

+ Once you start using a [clipboard manager](https://tapbots.com/pastebot/) on your computer and adapt your work-flow around it, you can never go back.

+ You can un-subscribe from junk mail by paying $2 for a 10 year membership at the Direct Marketing Association (DMA). You can also un-subcribe from credit card offers in the mail. ([More info from the FTC here](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0262-stopping-unsolicited-mail-phone-calls-and-email)). 

+ If you live in California it's worth investing in some [N95 masks](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008MCV1HY/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

+ If you post really long ridiculous captions on Instagram of a product and tag it with #ad, everyone will believe you've been sponsored by Coke (even though you have like 50 followers) and ask you about it the next time they see you.

+ I'll soon (maybe) finally get CarPlay in my car. This will be a truly incredible day 2 years in the making. I don't even know what else in life I'm waiting for at that point.

+ I've been made aware that a [HomeKit supported essential oil diffuser](https://www.macrumors.com/review/vocolinc-flowerbud/) is available, and this is so ridiculous that I might just need to own one.

+ There are many trade offs to using Sublime vs a full featured IDE and I don't think I'll ever be fully happy with either.

+ Dark Mode on Mojave is nice.

+ Not having to use Windows ever ever is a great blessing that I will never take for granted. Not having to use Windows APIs is an even bigger blessing.

+ 👏👏 House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi 👏👏
